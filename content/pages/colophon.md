## The human

### Who?

*Happen to be* an editor and membership program producer at [SSPAI](https://sspai.com), a content community focused on digital products and cultures.

*Used to be* a transactional lawyer ([until July 2021](/2021/07/postmortem-on-a-jobby-job/)).

*Born to be* a nerd.

### Whereof?

*Personalities* are hard to describe, but I’m constantly tested as an [INTJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=INTJ&redirect=no), which means — if you insist — more Introverted than extraverted, perceiving by iNtuition more than sensing, judging by Thinking more than feeling, and perferring use of the Judging function than the perceiving one. I don’t take MBTI seriously, though, and the reference here is only for convenience.

*Politics* are hard to discuss, but I roughly identify as a [progressive conservatist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_conservatism), which means when there’s a conflict, I generally put more vaule on the market than equality, liberty than authority, progress than tradition, and ecology than production.

### Whence?

Shouting and murmuring on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PlatyHsu) and [Weibo](https://www.weibo.com/1933586711/profile).

iPhoneographing on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/platy_hsu).

Flagging spams — but waiting for humanely greetings — at `hi (at) cyhsu.net`, or `platyhsu (at) sspai.com` for work purposes.

## The site

### What for?

*Neverland* is a place for me to store trivia which I think are even ineligible for Evernote. So far, it contains verbose logs of fiddling with my devices, buggy translations of articles that caught my (not necessarily your) eyes, casual excerpts from the Internet, et cetera. As the name conveys, you could *never* expect something useful from it, but neither could you expect you will *never* find one.

Blogging seems to be an anachronism in this information-abundant era. After all, what’s the point jotting down words that may *never* be revisited even by yourself, only to add entropy to a system already chaotic enough to make people fatigue?

There is a distinction, however, between being selective to consume and to produce content. Surely it won’t make any visible contribution to enlarge a huge pie by a zillionth in, but neither will it do any harm. And, it might be this very addition that helps one in need. As such, the words here don’t exist for being useful. They exist for a potential future me or someone else in search of resonance, recollections, or reconcilement. If there is a possibility, there is a dynamic.

Never say never — Because we say “never” by believing in the “ever.”

### Chinglish?

For two reasons:

*The technical reason* is I prefer to write in whichever language my inner voice spoke when I was thinking about the topic because it’s easier.

*The philosophical reason* is the separation of language can serve as a [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). As the mother tongue, Chinese can sometimes feel too intimate and natural to express in candidly. Modern Chinese is also becoming regretfully meme- and Newspeak-liked, lacking the tool to write seriously and analytically with. English, though not without problem of its own, provides an alternative for a cowardly, escapist, or cynical me to think and write in. See also Yiyun Li’s [*To Speak Is to Blunder*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/02/to-speak-is-to-blunder), one of my favorite essays of all time.

### Making-of?

As of February 2022, *Neverland* is built with Hugo and hosted on Netlify. Prior to that, it was a self-hosted instance of WordPress. I may write about the rationale and process when time permits, but the gist is that the WordPress’ block-based [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) experience turns out to be too voracious for my low-end virtual box and too fiddly for me as a minimalist. On the other hand, the static site generators and serverless providers have really come a long way since my previous flirting with Hexo. That you can set up a simple blog, certificated and CDN’d in minutes is no longer a goal, but a given.
