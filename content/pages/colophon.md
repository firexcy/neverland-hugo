Fascinated with the digital world, I appreciate all the convenience and sparks brought by ether and gadgets. I enjoy facilitating everyday life with digital devices and I’m always in search of methods to improve productivity. That being said, [laziness, impatience, and hubris](http://threevirtues.com) are the virtues I always extol.

### Where else can I find you on the net?

Alongside those stiff metal boxes, I would also add some softer and more humanistic brushes to my life by designing and photographing (mostly iPhoneographing), which you can see on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/platy_hsu). You can also hear some of my shouts & murmurs on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PlatyHsu) and [Weibo](https://www.weibo.com/1933586711/profile).

Of course, the good old email is always welcomed: direct your message to `hi (at) cyhsu.net`. For work purposes, please contact `platyhsu (at) sspai.com`.

## About the Site

### What is this site for?

_Neverland_ is a place for me to store trivia which I think are even ineligible for Evernote. So far, it contains verbose logs of fiddling with my devices, buggy translations of articles that caught my (not necessarily your) eyes, casual excerpts from the Internet, et cetera. As the name conveys, you could _never_ expect something useful from it, but neither could you expect you will _never_ find one.

Blogging seems to be an anachronism in this information-abundant era. After all, what’s the point jotting down words that may _never_ be revisited even by yourself, only to add entropy to a system already chaotic enough to make people fatigue?

There is a distinction, however, between being selective to consume and to produce content. Surely it won’t make any visible contribution to enlarge a huge pie by a zillionth inch, but neither will it do any harm. And, it might be this very addition that helps one in need. As such, the words here don’t exist for being useful. They exist for a potential future me or someone else in search of resonance, recollections, or reconcilement. If there is a possibility, there is a dynamic.

Never say never — Because we say “never” by believing in the “ever.”

### I find a mishmash of Chinese and Chi/English. Why?

For two reasons:

- The technical reason: I prefer to write in whichever language my inner voice spoke when I was thinking about the topic because it’s easier.
- The philosophical reason: The separation of language can serve as a [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). As the mother tongue, Chinese can sometimes feel too intimate and natural to express in candidly. Modern Chinese is also becoming regretfully meme- and Newspeak-liked, lacking the tool to write seriously and analytically with. English, though not without problem of its own, provides an alternative for a cowardly, escapist, or cynical me to think and write in. See also Yiyun Li’s [_To Speak Is to Blunder_](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/02/to-speak-is-to-blunder), one of my favorite essays of all time.

### How is this site built?

As of February 2022, _Neverland_ is built with Hugo and hosted on Netlify. Prior to that, it was a self-hosted instance of WordPress. I may write about the rationale and process when time permits, but the gist is that the WordPress’ block-based [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) experience turns out to be too voracious for my low-end virtual box and too fiddly for me as a minimalist. On the other hand, the static site generators and serverless providers have really come a long way since my previous flirting with Hexo. That you can set up a simple blog, certificated and CDN’d in minutes is no longer a goal, but a given.

### I’m feeling generous. How can I buy you a cup of coffee?
