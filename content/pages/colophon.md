Fascinated with the digital world, I appreciate all the convenience and sparks brought by ether and gadgets. I enjoy facilitating everyday life with digital devices and I’m always in search of methods to improve productivity. That being said, [laziness, impatience, and hubris](http://threevirtues.com) are the virtues I always extol.

### Where else can I find you on the net?

Alongside those stiff metal boxes, I would also add some softer and more humanistic brushes to my life by designing and photographing (mostly iPhoneographing), which you can see on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/platy_hsu). You can also hear some of my shouts & murmurs on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PlatyHsu) and [Weibo](https://www.weibo.com/1933586711/profile).

Of course, the good old email is always welcomed: direct your message to `hi (at) cyhsu.net`. For work purposes, please contact `platyhsu (at) sspai.com`.

## About the Site

### What is this site for?

_Neverland_ is a place for me to store trivia which I think are even ineligible for Evernote. So far, it contains verbose logs of fiddling with my devices, buggy translations of articles that caught my (not necessarily your) eyes, casual excerpts from the Internet, et cetera. As the name conveys, you could _never_ expect something useful from it, but neither could you expect you will _never_ find one.

Blogging seems to be an anachronism in this information-abundant era. After all, what’s the point jotting down words that may _never_ be revisited even by yourself, only to add entropy to a system already chaotic enough to make people fatigue?

There is a distinction, however, between being selective to consume and to produce content. Surely it won’t make any visible contribution to enlarge a huge pie by a zillionth inch, but neither will it do any harm. And, it might be this very addition that helps one in need. As such, the words here don’t exist for being useful. They exist for a potential future me or someone else in search of resonance, recollections, or reconcilement. If there is a possibility, there is a dynamic.

Never say never — Because we say “never” by believing in the “ever.”

### I find a mishmash of Chinese and Chi/English. Why?

For two reasons:

- The technical reason: I prefer to write in whichever language my inner voice spoke when I was thinking about the topic because it’s easier.
- The philosophical reason: The separation of language can serve as a [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). As the mother tongue, Chinese can sometimes feel too intimate and natural to express in candidly. Modern Chinese is also becoming regretfully meme- and Newspeak-liked, lacking the tool to write seriously and analytically with. English, though not without problem of its own, provides an alternative for a cowardly, escapist, or cynical me to think and write in. _See also_, the awesome Yiyun Li’s [_To Speak Is to Blunder_](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/02/to-speak-is-to-blunder), one of my favorite essays of all time.

### How is this site built?

#### Backend

As of April 2021, _Neverland_ is built with WordPress.

In the past, I have also tried several static site generators, including Hexo and Jekyll. But since I have no coding background after all, it turns out that too much headache is involved to (a) make it possible to post from anywhere including from mobile devices and (b) customize the style and functions beyond the scope of the limited themes and plugins in the frameworks’ official catalogs. WordPress provides an all-in-one solution that is well tested, easily extensible, and infinitely customizable, which caters to my needs well at this stage. That said, I may look to greener grass on other sides in the future; who knows.

#### Hosting

_Neverland_, along with other public and private sites I run, is hosted on a VPS instance on [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=htmJiZ9xVmcV) (affiliated link).

In the past, I have also hosted my blog on Github Pages (as a static site), Vultr, and DigitalOcean (as a WordPress site). The load and traffic of the site is so light that I haven’t got a chance to experienced any performance or networking issue with any of them. I switched to Hetzner simply for value considerations. They provide a combo of 2-core AMD EPYC processor, 2 GB of RAM, and 40 GB of SSD storage at a NVMe-level speed, at a reasonable price of €3.5 per month; that’s a significantly generous offer compared with the 1 core vCPU, 512 MB of RAM, and 20 GB SATA SSD storage spec you usually get from U.S. operators for $5 per month.

Images and occasional downloadables are hosted externally on CloudApp, which in turn uses Amazon S3 as their storage bucket. I’m neither satisfied nor unsatisfied with the service — file sharing and hosting is an established SaaS sector and dullness is more a feature than a bug. I’ve been using it after purchasing a “lifetime” unlimited license years ago on a sale.

#### Routing, and why the site appears to be slow

The aforementioned Hetzner instance where _Neverland_ floats is physically located at Falkenstein, Germany. As far as I know, the routing between their data center and mainland China is not “optimized” whatsoever (e.g., no _CN2_ routing or `59.43` in _Hostloc_ers’ jargon), resulting in an average latency around 200 milliseconds. Not ideal, but good enough for a petite, personal weblog.

The subdomain `type.cyhsu.xyz` is registered with Cloudflare and put behind their CDN; its certificate is issued by Let’s Encrypt.

CloudApp, the image hosting service, appears to distribute the resources utilizing AWS’ CDN capacities and the responding server varies with the visitor’s IP. Unfortunately, as AWS being a frequent target of `$YOU_KNOW_WHAT`, domestic visitors’ access to blog images may be throttled or failed.

Frankly, I have a reckless and Hedonist attitude towards the domestic availability of this site. No proud if the connection is fast and undisturbed; no worry if not. I particularly won’t bother to register my site with the PenguinCo and the OldWaveCo so that links to here posted inside their walls can be followed without warnings — I deem such annoyances as Certificates of Quality™.

After all, I don’t think most readers of this site will be fazed by those artificial barriers — I’ve noticed from the site’s statistics that it has visitors from all over the world, who I believe are mostly inorganic agents of my compatriots and welcome warmly. For the sake of such flatter, don’t be mad at me if you think _Neverland_ is too slow.

### I’m feeling generous. How can I buy you a cup of coffee?
