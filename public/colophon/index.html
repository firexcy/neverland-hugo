<h2 id="about-the-site">About the Site</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-this-site-for">What is this site for?</h3>
<p><em>Neverland</em> is a place for me to store trivia which I think are even ineligible for Evernote. So far, it contains verbose logs of fiddling with my devices, buggy translations of articles that caught my (not necessarily your) eyes, casual excerpts from the Internet, et cetera. As the name conveys, you could <em>never</em> expect something useful from it, but neither could you expect you will <em>never</em> find one.</p>
<p>Blogging seems to be an anachronism in this information-abundant era. After all, what’s the point jotting down words that may <em>never</em> be revisited even by yourself, only to add entropy to a system already chaotic enough to make people fatigue?</p>
<p>There is a distinction, however, between being selective to consume and to produce content. Surely it won’t make any visible contribution to enlarge a huge pie by a zillionth inch, but neither will it do any harm. And, it might be this very addition that helps one in need. As such, the words here don’t exist for being useful. They exist for a potential future me or someone else in search of resonance, recollections, or reconcilement. If there is a possibility, there is a dynamic.</p>
<p>Never say never — Because we say “never” by believing in the “ever.”</p>

<h3 id="i-find-a-mishmash-of-chinese-and-chienglish-why">I find a mishmash of Chinese and Chi/English. Why?</h3>
<p>For two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The technical reason: I prefer to write in whichever language my inner voice spoke when I was thinking about the topic because it’s easier.</li>
<li>The philosophical reason: The separation of language can serve as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a>. As the mother tongue, Chinese can sometimes feel too intimate and natural to express in candidly. Modern Chinese is also becoming regretfully meme- and Newspeak-liked, lacking the tool to write seriously and analytically with. English, though not without problem of its own, provides an alternative for a cowardly, escapist, or cynical me to think and write in. <em>See also</em>, the awesome Yiyun Li’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/02/to-speak-is-to-blunder"><em>To Speak Is to Blunder</em></a>, one of my favorite essays of all time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-is-this-site-built">How is this site built?</h3>
<h4 id="backend">Backend</h4>
<p>As of April 2021, <em>Neverland</em> is built with WordPress.</p>
<p>In the past, I have also tried several static site generators, including Hexo and Jekyll. But since I have no coding background after all, it turns out that too much headache is involved to (a) make it possible to post from anywhere including from mobile devices and (b) customize the style and functions beyond the scope of the limited themes and plugins in the frameworks’ official catalogs. WordPress provides an all-in-one solution that is well tested, easily extensible, and infinitely customizable, which caters to my needs well at this stage. That said, I may look to greener grass on other sides in the future; who knows.</p>
<h4 id="hosting">Hosting</h4>
<p><em>Neverland</em>, along with other public and private sites I run, is hosted on a VPS instance on <a href="https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=htmJiZ9xVmcV">Hetzner</a> (affiliated link).</p>
<p>In the past, I have also hosted my blog on Github Pages (as a static site), Vultr, and DigitalOcean (as a WordPress site). The load and traffic of the site is so light that I haven’t got a chance to experienced any performance or networking issue with any of them. I switched to Hetzner simply for value considerations. They provide a combo of 2-core AMD EPYC processor, 2 GB of RAM, and 40 GB of SSD storage at a NVMe-level speed, at a reasonable price of €3.5 per month; that’s a significantly generous offer compared with the 1 core vCPU, 512 MB of RAM, and 20 GB SATA SSD storage spec you usually get from U.S. operators for $5 per month.</p>
<p>Images and occasional downloadables are hosted externally on CloudApp, which in turn uses Amazon S3 as their storage bucket. I’m neither satisfied nor unsatisfied with the service — file sharing and hosting is an established SaaS sector and dullness is more a feature than a bug. I’ve been using it after purchasing a “lifetime” unlimited license years ago on a sale.</p>
<h4 id="routing-and-why-the-site-appears-to-be-slow">Routing, and why the site appears to be slow</h4>
<p>The aforementioned Hetzner instance where <em>Neverland</em> floats is physically located at Falkenstein, Germany. As far as I know, the routing between their data center and mainland China is not “optimized” whatsoever (e.g., no <em>CN2</em> routing or <code>59.43</code> in _Hostloc_ers’ jargon), resulting in an average latency around 200 milliseconds. Not ideal, but good enough for a petite, personal weblog.</p>
<p>The subdomain <code>type.cyhsu.xyz</code> is registered with Cloudflare and put behind their CDN; its certificate is issued by Let’s Encrypt.</p>
<p>CloudApp, the image hosting service, appears to distribute the resources utilizing AWS’ CDN capacities and the responding server varies with the visitor’s IP. Unfortunately, as AWS being a frequent target of <code>$YOU_KNOW_WHAT</code>, domestic visitors’ access to blog images may be throttled or failed.</p>
<p>Frankly, I have a reckless and Hedonist attitude towards the domestic availability of this site. No proud if the connection is fast and undisturbed; no worry if not. I particularly won’t bother to register my site with the PenguinCo and the OldWaveCo so that links to here posted inside their walls can be followed without warnings — I deem such annoyances as Certificates of Quality™.</p>
<p>After all, I don’t think most readers of this site will be fazed by those artificial barriers — I’ve noticed from the site’s statistics that it has visitors from all over the world, who I believe are mostly inorganic agents of my compatriots and welcome warmly. For the sake of such flatter, don’t be mad at me if you think <em>Neverland</em> is too slow.</p>
