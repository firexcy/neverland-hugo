			<blockquote>
<p>This is not a perfect party. We are not a perfect people. Yet, we are called to a perfect mission. Our mission: to feed the hungry; to clothe the naked; to house the homeless; to teach the illiterate; to provide jobs for the jobless; and to choose the human race over the nuclear race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>吾党并非至善之党，吾人亦非至善之人，然则应召以竟至善之业。曰：赈饥馑而衣短褐，庇寒士而教愚人，创公职以纳无业，避核战以趋人性。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My constituency is the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>居于选区者，或亡命，或多舛，或丧产，或见轻，或受鄙。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is the call of conscience, redemption, expansion, healing, and unity. Leadership must heed the call of conscience, redemption, expansion, healing, and unity, for they are the key to achieving our mission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>闾阎之所呼，仁、赎、扩、医、统耳。既身为统领，则必响应于民，施仁、求赎、谋扩、行医、促统，以其为我大业所不可或缺也。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only leadership—that intangible combination of gifts, the discipline, information, circumstance, courage, timing, will and divine inspiration—can lead us out of the crisis in which we find ourselves. Leadership can mitigate the misery of our nation. Leadership can part the waters and lead our nation in the direction of the Promised Land. Leadership can lift the boats stuck at the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>领导力者，天赋、风纪、博识、情势、勇武、天时、笃志、神启之无形结合也。吾人深陷危机，非凭其力不足以脱身。领导力可抚国殇、可分江海，可引国族往福地、可救沉舟于深渊。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If, in my high moments, I have done some good, offered some service, shed some light, healed some wounds, rekindled some hope, or stirred someone from apathy and indifference, or in any way along the way helped somebody, then this campaign has not been in vain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>若得意之时，或为善、或行便、或掌微光、或疗伤痛、或燃希望于将熄、或挽他人于冷漠，唯此助人种种，成就其一，则此竞选，非徒劳无益矣。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If, in my low moments, in word, deed or attitude, through some error of temper, taste, or tone, I have caused anyone discomfort, created pain, or revived someone's fears, that was not my truest self.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>若失意之际，有阵怒、庸识、谬言，见于言辞、举止、情态，而令他人感不悦、生苦痛、燃恐惧，则实非我本愿。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This campaign has taught me much; that leaders must be tough enough to fight, tender enough to cry, human enough to make mistakes, humble enough to admit them, strong enough to absorb the pain, and resilient enough to bounce back and keep on moving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>经此竞选，受益良多：为领导者，必至刚而善战，至柔而能悲，至仁而有过，至谦而愿悔，至强而足忍，至韧而可持。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But our healthy competition should make us better, not bitter. We must use the insight, wisdom, and experience of the late Hubert Humphrey as a balm for the wounds in our Party, this nation, and the world. We must forgive each other, redeem each other, regroup, and move on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>但彼此竞争本为良性，理应促成进步而非招致戕害。是故必承续故人汉弗莱之志，以洞察、智慧、经验为此党、此国、此天下之伤敷药止痛，必与对手互谅以相救，重振而前行。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>America is not like a blanket—one piece of unbroken cloth, the same color, the same texture, the same size. America is more like a quilt: many patches, many pieces, many colors, many sizes, all woven and held together by a common thread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>美利坚并非新毯，同色同质，齐长齐宽而一体无缝；而更似陈褥，细碎缝补、参差异色而一线同织。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have proven that we can survive without each other. But we have not proven that we can win and make progress without each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>若无相互扶助，苟且求生，虽已证可行；求胜图强，却绝无先例。</p>
